## üìñ About

**Redmine Jira Integration** is a production-ready, standalone Laravel application that enables seamless bi-directional synchronization between Redmine and Jira issue tracking systems. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a robust bridge between development teams using Redmine and QA teams using Jira, ensuring real-time data consistency across both platforms.

Unlike plugin-based solutions that require installation into Redmine or Jira (which can cause performance issues, version compatibility problems, and maintenance headaches), this application operates as an independent microservice. It communicates with both systems exclusively through their official REST APIs, making it more resilient, scalable, and easier to maintain.

The application features a modern web-based management interface built with Inertia.js and Vue 3, allowing teams to configure connections, define field mappings, and monitor synchronization activity in real-time. With webhook support for instant updates, queue-based async processing, and comprehensive error handling, it's designed for enterprise-grade reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Connecting to Redmine and Jira

The application requires API access to both Redmine and Jira instances. Configure connections through the web interface:

1. **Redmine Connection**: Provide base URL and API key from a user with appropriate permissions
2. **Jira Connection**: Provide base URL, email, and API token from Atlassian account settings
3. **Test Connections**: Use the built-in connection tester to verify credentials

### Webhook Configuration

For real-time synchronization, configure webhooks in both systems:

- **Redmine**: Requires a webhook plugin (e.g., Redmine Webhook Plugin)
- **Jira**: Native webhook support in Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Webhooks

Webhook endpoints:
- Redmine: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/redmine`
- Jira: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/jira`

For detailed configuration instructions, see **[Setup Guide](docs/setup/SETUP_GUIDE.md)**.
